    The Spy Who Loved Me is the ninth novel and tenth book in Ian Fleming's James Bond series. First published on 16 April 1962, it is the shortest and most sexually explicit of Fleming's novels, as well as the only Bond novel told in the first person. Its narrator is a young Canadian woman, Viv Michel. Bond does not appear until two-thirds of the way through the book, arriving at precisely the right moment to save Viv from being raped and murdered. Fleming wrote a prologue to the novel giving the character Viv credit as a co-author. The story uses a recurring motif of Saint George against the dragon, and contains themes of power and the moral ambiguity between those acting with good and evil intent. The reviews were largely negative, with some expressing a desire for a return to the structure and form of the previous Bond novels. Fleming attempted to suppress elements of the book: he blocked a paperback edition and permitted Eon Productions to use only the book's title but not its plot.
