    Date: The 14th Day of October, 1702 <br>
    From: Captain Edward Blackwell <br>
    Aboard His Majesty’s Ship The Sovereign <br>
    At Sea, Near the West Indies <br>
    To: His Majesty, King William III of England <br>
    
    Your Majesty,
    
    I write to you with a most urgent plea, for dire circumstances have befallen us upon these treacherous waters. Our noble ship, The Sovereign, bound for the colonies, was mercilessly set upon by a band of lawless sea rogues—pirates of the most wicked kind—under the black flag of one known as Captain Samuel Drake.
    At dawn, as we sailed the Caribbean waters, a dark vessel emerged from the mist, its sails bearing the mark of death. With great swiftness, they gave chase, their cannons roaring like the wrath of the heavens. Outnumbered and outgunned, we fought valiantly, yet the enemy swarmed our decks, cut down our men, and seized our cargo of gold, spices, and gunpowder—rightful property of the Crown.
    I regret to inform Your Majesty that many of my men were slain or taken captive, and I myself barely escaped with the remnants of my crew. These black-hearted villains now roam free, plundering your Majesty’s seas without fear or mercy. I beseech you, send forth your Royal Navy to hunt these devils and restore order to these waters, lest they grow bolder and threaten our dominion over the trade routes.
    With what remains of my ship and my strength, I vow to pursue these wretches until justice is served. Yet, without reinforcements, our chances are grim. Your Majesty’s swift action could be the salvation of your loyal subjects and the honor of the Crown.
    I remain, as ever, your faithful servant and subject,
    
    Captain Edward Blackwell
    Commander of The Sovereign
